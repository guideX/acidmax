fmod_mIRC.dll - Change Log
NOTE: Syntax may change between releases, so read to know what you are updating into.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.00  [08/05/03] -It's party time :)

-File Versions now are just a floating point number by request; no two periods.
-Downloading fmod api is not neccessary for compile anymore...I made my own, better than the stinkin api's =P
-The main dll size is much smaller now by about 30K
-Plugin System is implemented (Many of the functions in the plugins have changed syntax)
--The background color bug has been fixed
--Background images can be loaded now
--Removed the random color fill function
-Padded/moved around everything in fmod_mIRC so you can remark one line out from fmod_mIRC_exports.h and recompile
 so you don't have to have that code included = very easy way to cut out stuff you don't use to
 minimize dll size.
-Changed fmod.dll thats included in the package from 3.6.2.0 to 3.7.0.0(beta)
-Implemented fmod's SOUND_GetCurrentLevels.
-Fixed SOUND_Sample_GetLoopPoints (pointer passing error).
-Fixed Sound_GetDriverCaps
-Fixed the "1 no errors" bug in many functions, there still might be more...too many functions to check
-Fixed a small small bug in StrGetTok
-Using static library files now for parts of the compile
-Updated to api LoadSongMemory to LoadSongEx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.92.2[04/19/03]
-Added AD_SetBG function...I forgot to add this in earlier
-Added a note about 25ms in documentation, didn't really change anything.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.92  [04/17/03]
-Added Auto Draw functions for a spectrum analyzer and oscilloscope.  These two
 are very well done.  They have plenty of effects you can do through them which
 have been made for it as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.88  [04/14/03]
-Added the fmod built in GetError routine into most of the fmod_mIRC routines so
 that newbie users can detect their mistakes faster.
-Fixed some functions return type mistakes...
-Added some of the return length in ms commands to have optional last value of 1
 to return the milliseconds length formatted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.87  [04/08/03] -No crashing related to streams, more error checking.
-Took out .isloaded from structs...they weren't needed since a pointer of 0/NULL
 would just mean the same thing.
-Added lots more error checking for to the functions that would need it.
-Fixed some stream free'ing/playing bugs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.86  [04/07/03]
-Changed fmod.dll thats included in the package from 3.6.1.0 to 3.6.2.0
-Added a check for if they didn't "connect" to a fmod.dll instance, then it
 won't let them run the command, to prevent a lot of accidental crashes.
-Remade the project in VC.  The original one I had used that stupid "template"
 Which made me think I needed MFC.(im new to c++!!!)  So now the .dll is smaller
 And it unloads properly without freezing up.  I like this much better now.
 100K Smaller.
-Fixed unloading loop bug, i had < instead of <=
-Changed DLLVersion to DLL_Version, Changed DLLInfo to DLL_Info,  and added 
 edition DLL_Edition function
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.85  [04/06/03] -You better update...old versions had bad memory leaks
-Fixed massive amounts of memory leaks...(hey im new to c++!!!give me a break:))
 So...I don't think there is any memory leaks now :)
-Rewrote StrGetTok function (part of the dealing with memory leaks)
-Fixed lots of typos in code :/ like some hwnd's which were supposed to be awnd
-Changed Spectrum_on and Spectrum_off return value from OK to 1 ($true)
 This just makes it easier for you to code statement's for it in mIRC(less code)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8   [03/25/03]
-Initial Public Pre-Release
